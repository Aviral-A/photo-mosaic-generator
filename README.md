About:

This project is a photo mosaic generator. A photo mosaic refers to a photo which is recreated by turning the image into a matrix of tiles, in which each tile is replaced with an image. The resulting photo is the original photo recreated with a bunch of photos of the user prompt, arranged in such a way that the lighting and colors recreate the original image.
